        <p>
          I was responsible for designing, coding, and coordinating the creation of a small interactive video platform for Gucci. It is a stand-alone micro front-end piece, thought to be integrated into other brand projects, consisting of two sides: the first is a dashboard for video tagging and upload and the other is a responsive interactive video player that shows the products visible on the video as they appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea came from Gucci Project Manager while I was the team leader of a 4 developers squad, working at Euris. We worked with PHP/Lumen/MariaDb for the back end and Angular on the front end.
