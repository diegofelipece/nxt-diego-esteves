          Besides many features and regular maintenance, I had the mission of renovating some views of the project, reviewing UI and them implementing it. It is a web project and a sort of catalog, used during some special events to show exclusive products for selected clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          That work happened while I was the team leader of a 4 developers squad, working at Euris. The stack was PHP/Lumen/MariaDb for the back end and Angular on the front end.
