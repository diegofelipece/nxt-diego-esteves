        <p>
          In 2012 I had the idea of creating a custom "lorem ipsum" generator based on a classic Brazilian TV character called Mussum, so I designed a two-page website and put it online in a week. On the second day, the project went viral through Brazilian designers and developers and reached an unexpected 36.294 pageviews, during the first 5 days. As I write this on 2023 October, the term "mussum ipsum" reached more than +15,000 results on Google Search and it's present on more than +3,000 code files on Github.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, the project is on the 3rd version (static Next.js) which is a work in progress as new features and content may come by as I try to make it profitable someway.
