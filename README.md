# My Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for [@diegofelipece](https://github.com/diegofelipece)’s portfolio website [diegoesteves.ink](https://diegoesteves.ink).

As a developer, I find it useful to keep this as a public repository, so anyone interested can take a look at my code.

Over the years, I’ve had several different portfolio websites — and at some point, I even considered not having one anymore. As I transitioned from design to development, it became harder to visually showcase my work, and I noticed that many developers don’t even maintain personal portfolios. Still, I realized it’s part of who I am, and a simple way to express a bit of my identity and skills.

For this version, I decided to focus on two main goals: keeping hosting costs low and maintaining a simple structure for updates and maintenance. In the end, I chose to build a static website using Next.js — which was actually my first project with the framework. I also decided not to use any CMS, since I’m the one who updates the site myself, and given that portfolio updates aren’t that frequent, I’m still happy with that choice.

Hope you like it!
