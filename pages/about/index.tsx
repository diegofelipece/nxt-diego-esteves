                My name is Diego Esteves, I&apos;m {age} years old, born in S√£o Paulo ‚Äì Brazil, and living in Milan - Italy. In 2012 I&apos;ve got my university degree in Advertising Design, (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/mackenzie1870">Mackenzie</a> ‚Äì SP/Brazil) and I&apos;ve been working as a web developer and designer since 2010.
              </p>
              <p>
                To be more specific, it all started with design and advertising, with a considerable focus on the web. Back in 2010, the internet was really different from what it looks like today, so I started by making my own blogs and then started working with Flash websites (R.I.Pü™¶). Slowly I got more into what we call today front-end development when I moved from flash to HTML5 websites done mostly with jQuery and WordPress. So, for years, I worked both as a developer and designer for digital and also graphic stuff.
              </p>
              <p>
                During that period I had the opportunity to collaborate with many small design agencies and some of the lead Brazilian e-commerces, like Netshoes, B2W Group, and Dafiti. In 2015 I became a freelancer and at some point, I started diving into the Single Page Application world mainly with React and later Angular. I continued as a freelancer until 2018 when I moved to Italy ‚Äì initially Bologna and then Milan, and worked with many companies and agencies, like Unilever, Nexxus, CuboCC, Ita√∫, Anglo, and many others. In 2019 I started working at Gruppo Euris, which is still my current employer, initially for a project with ShopFully and since 2020/08 I lead a small group of 4 developers for Gucci as external consultants.

                As an independent comic writer and illustrator, I self published some small histories (all in Portuguese): &quot;A √öltima Vez Que Vi Richard&quot; (2014), &quot;A Vida Marinha&quot; (2017), and &quot;Agouro&quot; (2017). I also participated in the first issue of the magazine &quot;P√© de Cabra&quot;. You can see them all, and a lot of other stuff, at my old Tumblr, <a href="https://oincriveltediocotidiano.tumblr.com/">O Incr√≠vel T√©dio Cotidiano</a>.
