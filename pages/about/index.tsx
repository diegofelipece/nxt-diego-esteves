        My name is Diego Esteves, I'm ${age} years old, born in S√£o Paulo ‚Äì Brazil, and living in Milan - Italy. In 2012 I've got my university degree in Advertising Design, (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/mackenzie1870">Mackenzie</a> ‚Äì SP/Brazil) and I've been working as a web developer and designer since 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be more specific, it all started with design and advertising, with a considerable focus on the web. Back in 2010, the internet was really different from what it looks like today, so I started by making my own blogs and then started working with Flash websites (R.I.Pü™¶). Slowly I got more into what we call today front-end developer when I moved from flash to HTML5 websites done mostly with jQuery and WordPress. So, for years, I worked both as a developer and designer for digital and also graphic stuff.

      </p>
      <p>
        During that period I had the opportunity to collaborate with many small design agencies and some of the lead Brazilian e-commerces, like Netshoes, B2W Group, and Dafiti. In 2015 I became a freelancer and at some point, I started diving into the Single Page Application world mainly with React and later Angular. I continued as a freelancer until 2018 when I moved to Italy ‚Äì initially Bologna and then Milan, and worked with many companies and agencies, like Unilever, Nexxus, CuboCC, Ita√∫, Anglo, and many others. In 2019 I started working at Gruppo Euris, which is still my current employer, initially for a project with ShopFully and since 2020/08 I lead a small group of 4 developers for Gucci as external consultants.

        As an independent comic writer and illustrator, I collaborated with some publications (all in Portuguese): "A √öltima Vez Que Vi Richard" (2014), "A Vida Marinha" (2017), and "Agouro" (2017). I also participated in the first issue of the magazine "P√© de Cabra". You can see them all, and a lot of other stuff, at my old Tumblr, <a href="https://oincriveltediocotidiano.tumblr.com/">O Incr√≠vel T√©dio Cotidiano</a>.
