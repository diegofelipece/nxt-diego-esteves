        My name is Diego Esteves, I'm ${age} years old, born in S√£o Paulo ‚Äì Brazil, living at Milan - Italy. At 2012 I've got my university degree on Advertising Design, (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/mackenzie1870">Mackenzie</a> ‚Äì SP/Brazil) and I've been working as web developer and designer since 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be more specific, it all started with design and advertising, with a considerable focus on web. Back in 2010 the internet was really different from what it looks like today, so I started by making my own blogs and then started working with Flash websites (R.I.Pü™¶). Slowly I got more into what we call today front-end developer, when I moved from flash to HTML5 websites done mostly with jQuery and WordPress. So for years I worked both as developer and designer for digital and also graphic stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        On that period I had the opportunity to collaborate with many small design agencies and some of the lead Brazilian e-commerces, like Netshoes, B2W Group, and Dafiti. At 2015 I became freelancer and at some point I stated  diving into Single Page Application's world mainly with React and later Angular. I continued as freelancer until 2018 when I moved to Italy ‚Äì initially Bologna and then Milan. During that period I had the opportunity to work with many companies and agencies, like Unilever, Nexxus, CuboCC, Ita√∫, Anglo and many others. At 2019 I started working at Gruppo Euris, which still my current employer, initially for a project with ShopFully and  since 2020/08 I lead a small group of 4 developers for Gucci as external consultants.
