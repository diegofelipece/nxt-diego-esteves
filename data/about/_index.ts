      <p>My name is Diego Esteves, I’m from Sao Paulo – Brazil, and I work as a front-end developer and designer.</p>
      <p>I’ve got a university degree on Advertising, (U. P. Mackenzie – SP/Brazil) and I’ve been working in this area since 2010.</p>
      <p>It all began with the design. Where I’ve started working with offline media, but quickly I’ve changed my focus to the Web, at those times we used to make Flash websites. Over the years, that neared me from what we call today front-end developer, on the other side I’ve studied illustration as a branch of my design knowledge, which led me to experiment more and start making comics.</p>
      <p>Over the last 10 years I have worked at some of the largest Brazilians e-commerces, such as Netshoes, B2W Group, and Dafiti, and also at some small design studios in Sao Paulo, Brazil. At 2015 I become a freelancer, activity that allowed me to be more flexible and work between different areas, then finally at 2018, I’ve moved from Sao Paulo (BR) to Bologna (IT), where I’m living since them. At 2019 I’ve started working on Euris, and having a good time as Front End Developer of many React projects.</p>
      <p>You can find more information about my skills and experience at my Linkedin or even, sending me a “hi” at hello@diegoesteves.ink</p>
